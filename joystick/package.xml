  <description>The triskar_joystick package. It is supposed to listen to a PS3 like joystick and 
  publish twist messages for controlling the triskar robot base. Those messages have linear and 
  angular velocities informations.
  
  The analog axis:
  	LEFT: Linear velocity (x-y plane)
  	RIGTH: Rotation:
  	
  Buttons:
  	6:	allows commands to be transmited. If not pressed, no commands are going to be published by the
  		subscriber ros node (robogame_joystick).
  	8:  allows automatic rotation (player following on the z-axis).
  	4:	increases current linear velocity by 5%. (Change happens on the proportional linear gain)
  	3:	decreases current linear velocity by 5%. (Change happens on the proportional linear gain)
  	1:	increases current angular velocity by 5%. (Change happens on the proportional angular gain)
  	2:	decreases current angular velocity by 5%. (Change happens on the proportional angular gain)
  	mode:	allows linear comand on the cross axis instead of analog LEFT.
