 *  @brief Implements Goal-Oriented Behavior for Decision Making
 *
 *  @section DESCRIPTION
 *  
 *  This is a program that implements the Goal-Oriented Behavior
 *  for Decision Making in Robogame. We follow the technique 
 *  description in "Millington, Ian, and John Funge. Artificial
 *  intelligence for games. CRC Press, 2009."
 *  
 *  The robotic agent may have one or more goals, also called <motives>.
 *  Each goal has a level of importance (often called <insistence>)
 *  represented by a number. A goal with a high insistence will
 *  tend to influence the agentâ€™s behavior more strongly.
 *
 *  The character will try to fulfill the goal or to reduce its 
 *  insistence. Some goals may be completely satisfied (such as "reaching 
 *  a position""). Others always have some positive insistence, and
 *  the agent simply reduce the insistence. A zero value for insistence
 *  is equivalent to a completely satisfied goal.
